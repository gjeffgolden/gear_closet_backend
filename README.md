# Gear Closet Backend - Django API

An online gear management system for outdoor recreation.

## General Info

- Project was completed as the backend for my Mod 5 final capstone project for Flatiron School
- Django RESTful API with full auth using djangorestframework, djangorestframework_simplejwt and django-cors-headers
- My first-ever Django API, coming from a Rails background -- an awesome learning experience with a new language and framework!
- Connects to the [Gear Closet Frontend Repo](https://github.com/gjeffgolden/gear-closet-frontend)

## Features

- Create New Users
- Secure Login
- Full CRUD for Items (individual pieces of outdoor gear)
- 1:M relationship between Items and Users
- Image upload and storage via Firebase

## Technologies

- Django
- Python
- JWT
- Firebase

## Challenges

- Learning Django and Python on the fly while building a working schema using JWT auth and a 1:M relationship. The most frequent issues I hit involved CORS, which was a fantastic learning experience with middleware in Django.
